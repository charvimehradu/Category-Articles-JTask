# Categories - Articles
A Joomla! 4 site module to retrieve the last 3 articles from a specific category via the Joomla! API. This module allows the selection of the category as a parameter and the 3 articles returned show: title, author, published date and the intro text for the article (not the full article). Works for Joomla versions 4 and higher. This site module is installable through the Joomla Extension Manager and the specific instructions are listed below.

If you are a developer and want to contribute to this extension you can fork this repo.

## Words of Gratitude

Without the assistance and support of the Joomla community, my mentors, and the authors of the books I used to learn about Joomla extension development, this extension would not have been possible. I would especially like to thank [Christiane Maier-Stadtherr](https://github.com/chmst), [Olivier Buisard](https://github.com/obuisard), Philip Walton, and [Shivam Rajput](https://github.com/shivamdiehard) for introducing me to this task. Your enthusiasm and passion for Joomla inspired me to learn more about the platform and its development. I would also like to thank Astrid Günther for her books on Joomla 4 extension development. Her clear and concise explanations were invaluable in helping me understand the concepts and best practices involved in creating a Joomla extension. I am grateful to the entire Joomla community for providing a supportive and welcoming environment for learning and collaboration.

I am open to suggestions, bug reports, and feature requests. Please feel free to submit an issue or reach out to me directly with any feedback or inquiries.
